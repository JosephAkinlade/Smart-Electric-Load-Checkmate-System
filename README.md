# Smart-Electric-Load-checkmate-system

## Client: Ife Salau

This system is to curb the use of electrical appliances that are not allowed in halls of residence, e.g Hot plates. The system measures the current consumption in each room and sends a message to the Porters when an overcurrent is detected which indicates that a load that is not allowed has been connected. It also cuts off supply to that particular room.
